上次我听说约翰·辛格（John Sing）是在圣费尔南多山谷（San Fernando Valley）的一场音乐会上

385
0:39:34.760 --> 0:39:43.760
on the way back from the concert I said, John, since I've heard you, I never heard you sing as beautifully and as expressively as you did tonight.
在音乐会回来的路上，我说，约翰，自从我听到过你，我从未听过你像今晚那样像你那样精美和表现出色。

386
0:39:43.760 --> 0:39:49.760
And the audience reflected that. They were so wrapped and engrossed in,
观众反映了这一点。他们被包裹着并全神贯注，

387
0:39:49.760 --> 0:39:53.760
what are you doing? He said, you know, I owe it to Mr. Domingo.
你在干什么？他说，你知道，我欠多明哥先生。

388
0:39:53.760 --> 0:40:00.760
When we record it, perhaps love, you call to my attention the way he colored his notes with the meaning of the word
当我们录制它时，也许是爱，您会引起我的注意，就像他用单词的含义为他的笔记着色的方式

389
0:40:00.760 --> 0:40:06.760
when he sang clouds, sounded like clouds, when he sang steel, it sounded like steel.
当他唱歌的云听起来像云时，当他唱歌时，听起来像钢。

390
0:40:06.760 --> 0:40:13.760
So I started going through my songs and wherever there was a word that I could color the tone,
因此，我开始浏览自己的歌曲，无论有一个我可以上色的词，

391
0:40:13.760 --> 0:40:19.760
I found it just an interesting exercise and it works. Crowds love it.
我发现它只是一个有趣的练习，它起作用。人群喜欢它。

392
0:40:24.760 --> 0:40:30.760
I want you to be very comfortable, enjoy yourselves, lay back and let yourself go wherever the music takes you.
我希望您感到非常舒适，享受自己，躺下，让自己去任何带您到哪里。

393
0:40:30.760 --> 0:40:35.760
Anytime you feel like singing along, please feel very welcome to do that.
每当您想唱歌时，请非常欢迎这样做。

394
0:40:35.760 --> 0:40:40.760
Kindly limit yourself to the choruses of the song.

395
0:40:40.760 --> 0:40:46.760
Let me do the verses. It's my show.
让我来写诗句。 这是我的表演。

396
0:40:46.760 --> 0:40:51.760
I mean, all you had to do was be in Colorado somewhere when he would start singing Rocky Mountain High
我的意思是，你所要做的就是在科罗拉多州的某个地方，他就会开始唱《Rocky Mountain High》

397
0:40:51.760 --> 0:40:54.760
and I'd swear you could feel the whole state rocking.
我发誓你会感觉到整个州的摇摆。

398
0:40:54.760 --> 0:41:00.760
But it's such a fun sounding song and it has such a great guitar lick too. I mean, everybody wanted to play.
但这是一首听起来很有趣的歌曲，而且它的吉他弹奏也很棒。 我的意思是，每个人都想玩。

399
0:41:05.760 --> 0:41:10.760
That's one of the classic, at the time, it was sort of folk rock.
那是经典之一，在当时，它是一种民谣摇滚。

400
0:41:16.760 --> 0:41:25.760
That song is more than just a pop song, it's now folklore. It's part of our American heritage.
那首歌不仅是流行歌曲，而且现在是民间传说。这是我们美国遗产的一部分。

401
0:41:46.760 --> 0:41:50.760
It's a song that's been played for every door.
这是一首为每扇门播放的歌曲。

402
0:41:50.760 --> 0:42:00.760
When it first came to the mountains, his life was far away on the road, hanging by a song.
当它第一次来到山上时，他的生活在路上很远，挂在一首歌上。

403
0:42:00.760 --> 0:42:07.760
But the string's already broken and he doesn't really care.
但是绳子已经打破了，他真的不在乎。

404
0:42:07.760 --> 0:42:12.760
It keeps changing fast and it don't last long.

Swoosh! A meteor went smoking across the sky.

409
0:42:33.760 --> 0:42:39.760
It got bigger and bigger until the tail stretched out all the way across the sky and burned itself out.
它变得越来越大，直到尾巴一直延伸到天空中并燃烧出来。

410
0:42:39.760 --> 0:42:41.760
And it was raining fire in the sky.

这是掌声，有大的掌声，您可以从不同的睡袋中听到。

我对这首歌和他死去的朋友的真实故事感到有点害怕。

417
0:43:31.760 --> 0:43:37.760
The song is autobiographical. He sings the truth and that was very important to him.
